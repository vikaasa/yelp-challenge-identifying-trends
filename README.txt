I have attached a python notebook, and 3 R scripts.
The following steps must be taken to run the programs.

1. First, the yelp dataset must be downloaded from https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge, and extracted into the project working directory.
2. Then, Spark must be downloaded and installed from http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html, and must be placed in the working directory.
3. Then, Anaconda Python 2.7 must be installed from https://www.continuum.io/downloads.
4. Install R Studio
5. Now, open the terminal, cd to the working directory, and run the command: "jupyter notebook"
6. Then open the python notebook "Yelp_Trends_and_Opportunities_Analyzer.ipynb"
7. Run the R scripts independantly using the CSVs exported while running the ipython notebook. Before running the R scripts, make sure that the necessary packages are installed. 

The final results are included in the CSV "business_opportunities.csv".
